    "## Creative Design – “PoetMate”\n",
    "\n",
    "**PoetMate: A Creative Writing Assistant for Historical Poetic Styles**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "**PoetMate** is a writing assistant powered by a large language model (LLM), designed to help users experiment with poetic language from across literary history. By blending creative prompting with stylistic emulation, the tool enables users to co-create original poems in the voice of different periods, authors, or traditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is not to generate perfect poetry, but to support experimentation and learning in a low-pressure, interactive space. PoetMate is especially aimed at students, educators, and hobbyist writers across the arts and humanities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interaction Design\n",
    "\n",
    "### How users interact:\n",
    "- Users select a poetic **style or influence** (e.g. Romanticism, Haiku, Harlem Renaissance).\n",
    "- They enter a **theme or emotional prompt** (e.g. \"grief\", \"revolution\", \"the night sky\").\n",
    "- The model generates an initial draft poem.\n",
    "- Users can then ask:\n",
    "  - “Add more metaphor”\n",
    "  - “Explain the rhyme scheme”\n",
    "  - “Can you make it sound more like Emily Dickinson?”\n",
    "  - “Add a modern twist to the last line”\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the AI does:\n",
    "- Responds with stylistically consistent rewrites or elaborations\n",
    "- Explains structural or linguistic choices\n",
    "- Suggests historical context or related poets\n",
    "- Highlights poetic devices used in the draft (e.g. enjambment, assonance)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools involved:\n",
    "- A chat-based web interface or notebook\n",
    "- A fine-tuned GPT-like model with prompt-engineering for poetry modes\n",
    "- (Optional) Access to a curated dataset of poetic examples\n",
    "- (Optional) Export to PDF, writing portfolio, or zine format\n",
    "\n",
    "## Value of the Design\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning\n",
    "- Encourages deeper understanding of poetic structure and form\n",
    "- Allows users to explore unfamiliar literary traditions through practice\n",
    "- Supports humanities pedagogy through creative inquiry\n",
    "\n",
    "### Engagement\n",
    "- Makes poetry writing interactive and playful\n",
    "- Promotes iteration and feedback rather than fear of failure\n",
    "- Ideal for workshops, online courses, and informal learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inclusion\n",
    "- Supports users with different levels of literary experience\n",
    "- Can accommodate multiple dialects, styles, and poetic heritages\n",
    "- Makes poetic expression accessible for second-language learners and neurodiverse users\n",
    "\n",
    "## Critical Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "PoetMate reflects both the potential and the challenges of using AI in creative arts contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Positive impacts:**\n",
    "- It can democratise access to poetic techniques and histories.\n",
    "- It supports learners who might otherwise feel intimidated by formal poetry.\n",
    "- It builds bridges between literature and technology in an approachable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential limitations and risks:**\n",
    "- The model might reinforce dominant styles, neglecting less-represented voices.\n",
    "- It may blur lines between human-authored and machine-generated work, raising authorship questions.\n",
    "- Users might become over-reliant on suggestions, inhibiting their personal voice.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these concerns, the design includes reflective features such as:\n",
    "- \"Explain your choices\" prompts\n",
    "- Citations of literary inspirations\n",
    "- A collaborative “edit mode” encouraging user revision\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, **PoetMate** is not just a tool to generate poems — it’s a creative scaffold that invites users to explore, adapt, and shape poetic language as part of a broader learning journey in the arts and humanities.\n"
