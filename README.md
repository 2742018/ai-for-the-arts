# AI for the Arts and Humanities: Creative Coding Portfolio

## GUID: 2742018

## Purpose
This repository showcases my coding exercises and creative exploration of AI for the Arts and Humanities course.

## ðŸ“–Introduction
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the AI for the Arts and Humanities course. This space documents my journey through coding exercises, experiments, and creative explorations of how AI technologies intersect with arts and humanities disciplines.

I have combined Python programming with AI-assisted development tools like GitHub Copilot throughout this portfolio to build various interactive and media-rich projects. Each notebook demonstrates technical skill development and reflections on how AI can be thoughtfully applied to creative practices.


## Goals
- Learn GitHub basics for version control and collaboration.
- Build foundational skills in Python programming.
- Explore the use of Copilot and other AI tools to support coding.
- Experiment with media data (text, images, audio) in AI workflows.
- Design a creative AI application.
- Design and document a creative AI project for the arts and humanities.
