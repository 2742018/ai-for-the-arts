    "The print function is used to display output on the screen.\n",
    "In Python, functions are predefined blocks of code that perform specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Parentheses ():\n",
    "The parentheses () are used to enclose the arguments of the function.\n",
    "Arguments are the values or variables that the function will use.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Quotation Marks \"\":\n",
    "The quotation marks \"\" are used to define a string.\n",
    "A string is a sequence of characters, like words or sentences.\n",

    "4) String Argument:\n",
    "\"Hello, world!\" is the string argument passed to the print function.\n",
    "This tells the print function what to display.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Syntax: Python syntax is straightforward and easy to read. The print function is a basic example of how Python commands are structured.\n",
    "2) Indentation: Python uses indentation to define blocks of code, but for simple commands like print, indentation isn't necessary.\n",
    "3) Case Sensitivity: Python is case-sensitive, so print must be written in lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to try running this code in a Python environment or an online compiler to see the output! If you have any questions or need further clarification, just let me know. "

    "- Array (List): In Python, an array is typically represented as a list. Here, greetings is a list containing different ways to say \"Hello\".\n",
    "- Elements: Each item in the list is called an element. Our list has five elements: \"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Hey\", \"Hola\", and \"Bonjour\".\n",
    "\n",

    "- For Loop: The for loop iterates over each element in the greetings list. The variable greeting takes on the value of each element one by one.\n",
